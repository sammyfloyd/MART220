I chose not to use a Generative AI image model for one of my food images, but rather various clip arts and images online with a transparent background. This was to make the photos blend more in the environment, that way there wasn't a background that would clash with the p5.js and the foods actually looked like they were placed in there, rather than taken from a square photo. There is, of course, stil going to be a difference in art style or photorealism for the pictures I used, however. I didn't have a specific reason for using the ice cream and french toast other than the fact that I really like them. For the pizza on the other hand, I wanted a round one from a top-down view to put it in place of the sun. I thought it would be a fun idea! I think it ties in the random food objects just a bit. To find these, I just searched "____ clip art transparent".
